## Most Common PTD (Prior to Doc) Conditions

| Condition | What UW Wants | Fastest Way to Get It |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| VOE | Verbal or written employment verification | Use The Work Number (TWN) if employer participates. Otherwise fax VOE form to HR. Call to confirm receipt. |
| 4506-C Results | IRS tax transcript | Submit through Encompass. Takes 2-3 weeks right now. If rush, call IRS directly at REDACTED. |
| Gift Letter | Signed gift letter + donor bank stmt + transfer evidence | Email borrower our template. Remind them we need the DONOR's bank statement showing withdrawal, not just the deposit on borrower's side. |
| Large Deposit LOE | Letter explaining deposit >50% monthly income | Call borrower, get the story, then email them a draft they can sign. Saves 2-3 rounds of back and forth. |
| HOA Questionnaire | Completed HOA form for condo/PUD | Order directly from HOA management company. $150-250 fee. Don't wait for borrower to order - they'll forget. |

## Most Common PTC (Prior to Close) Conditions

| Condition | What UW Wants | Tips |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| Updated paystubs | Most recent 30 days | Request from borrower's payroll portal link if they have one. Remind them ALL pages including YTD summary. |
| Final title commitment | Updated title with no new exceptions | Call title company directly - don't email. Ask specifically about any new judgments or liens recorded since prelim. |
| Hazard insurance binder | Insurance with mortgagee clause | Get the insurance agent's direct number from the borrower upfront at file setup. You'll need it. |
| Flood cert | Flood zone determination | Auto-ordered through ServiceLink. If SFHA, immediately alert LO - borrower needs flood insurance quote and it can delay closing. |
| Final VOE | Verbal VOE within 10 biz days of closing | TWN re-verification or direct call to employer. Document date/time/person spoken with in Encompass notes. |
| Appraisal conditions | Subject-to repairs completed | Need re-inspection by appraiser ($150). Order through ValuTrac. Allow 5-7 days. |

## Workarounds and Time Savers

### When IRS Transcripts Are Taking Forever
- Check if borrower has IRS online account - they can download transcripts instantly
- If borrower has a CPA, the CPA may have copies of the filed returns with confirmation of filing
- **Note**: We technically need the actual 4506-C results per SOP, but I've seen UW accept CPA-certified copies as a bridge document with the transcript as a PTF condition. Check with your UW first.

### When VOE Is Stuck
- Employer won't respond to fax? Call the main number and ask for HR verification line
- Some large employers use third-party verification (TWN, Equifax Verification Services)
- For small businesses: ask borrower if employer will provide a direct letter on company letterhead (less formal but UW will usually accept for PTD, with full VOE as PTC)

### When Borrower Goes Dark
- Day 1-2: Email + text
- Day 3: Call + email with specific list of what's missing
- Day 5: CC the Loan Officer on email, ask LO to call
- Day 7: Escalate to Processing Manager
- Day 10: If still no response, discuss potential withdrawal with LO
- **Tip**: Set expectations at file setup. Tell borrower "I will need X, Y, Z from you within the next 5 days" so there are no surprises.

### Rate Lock Approaching Expiration
- Alert LO at **7 days** before expiration (not 5 days like the SOP says - trust me, you need the extra buffer)
- Pre-fill the extension request form so LO just has to sign
- If delay is Bank-caused (e.g., appraisal ordering delay, system outage), note this - extension fee may be waived

### Document Expiration Quick Reference
| Document | Expires After |
|----------|--------------|
| Pay stubs | 30 days from date |
| Bank statements | 60 days from statement date |
| Credit report | 120 days from pull date |
| Appraisal | 120 days from effective date (180 with recert) |
| VOE | 10 business days before closing |
| Title commitment | Check with title company - varies |

## LTV Limits by Property Type (Quick Reference)

**IMPORTANT**: The official limits are in LO-POL-001 Section 3. This is just my quick reference:

| Property Type | Conv Max LTV | FHA | VA | USDA |
|--------------|-------------|-----|-----|------|
| SFR | 97% | 96.5% | 100% | 100% |
| Condo | 97% | 96.5% | 100% | 100% |
| Townhouse | 97% | 96.5% | 100% | 100% |
| 2-unit | 85% | 96.5% | 100% | N/A |
| 3-4 unit | 75% | 96.5% | 100% | N/A |

> **NOTE 12/2024**: I was told by UW that townhouse max is actually 95% for conventional, not 97%. Need to verify this against the product matrix. The policy document I have says 97% for "1-4 unit" but apparently there's a separate townhouse guideline. If you have a townhouse over 95% LTV, check with your UW before assuming 97% is fine.
