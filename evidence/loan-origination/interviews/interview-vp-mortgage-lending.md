## Opening / Role Overview

**SC**: Robert, thank you for making time. Could you start by describing your role and how the mortgage lending operation is structured?

**RT**: Sure. I've been CLO at Meridian for six years. I oversee the entire retail mortgage operation - origination through servicing transfer. We have about 120 staff across origination: 35 loan officers across 12 branches primarily in Texas, with newer branches in Florida and Arizona. Processing team is centralized here at HQ - 15 processors, plus 8 underwriters, 3 closers, and support staff. We fund about 250-280 loans per month on average, roughly $85 million in volume. Mix is about 70% purchase, 30% refi, though that shifts with rates obviously.

**SC**: And the consumer direct channel?

**RT**: We launched that in Q3 2023. It's still small - maybe 15-18% of applications. All digital, borrower applies online or through the mobile app. We have 4 dedicated LOs handling consumer direct, but processing and underwriting are the same team. That's been a bit of a challenge, actually. The workflow is different - digital applicants expect faster turnaround but our processing team treats them the same as branch originations.

## Process and Systems

**DO**: Walk us through the technology stack supporting the operation.

**RT**: Encompass is our LOS - has been for about 8 years. We use it end-to-end: application intake, disclosure generation, document management, compliance checks, pipeline management. For appraisals we use ValuTrac as our AMC portal. Credit through MeridianCredit which aggregates the tri-merge. Title ordering is still somewhat manual - we have a preferred vendor list and processors choose based on geography and rotation. Flood certs through ServiceLink.

**DO**: Are there integration gaps you'd flag?

**RT**: A few. The biggest pain point is that Encompass doesn't have good automated alerts for document expiration. Our processors are tracking stale pay stubs and bank statements manually - one of them built a spreadsheet that the whole team uses now. I've asked IT to configure alerts in Encompass but it keeps getting deprioritized against other bank-wide IT projects. It's a workflow gap that creates risk.

**SC**: Anything else?

**RT**: The connection between Encompass and our HMDA reporting could be better. We do a lot of manual reconciliation. And honestly, our process model hasn't been updated since 2023 - Karen Mitchell on the Process Excellence team put it together but she moved to commercial lending and nobody picked it up. The as-is model doesn't reflect the consumer direct channel or some of the workflow changes we made last year.

## Underwriting and Exceptions

**SC**: How would you characterize the consistency of underwriting decisions across your team?

**RT**: Our three underwriters are experienced - U.Chen has been here 12 years, U.Patel 7 years, U.Ramirez 5 years. They're generally consistent on straightforward files. Where we see variation is on complex scenarios, particularly self-employed income calculations. Each underwriter has slightly different interpretations of the addback rules. Maria Santos - she's the VP of Underwriting - has been working on standardizing this, but the SOP could use more detail on those edge cases.

**DO**: We noticed the SOP is past its review date.

**RT**: Yes, it was due for review in November 2024. Maria's been stretched thin. She's been handling the underwriting manager role as well since Tom left in August 2024 and we haven't backfilled. That's created a single point of dependency - Maria is the only one who can approve complex exceptions, and she's also supposed to be reviewing and updating the SOP. Something has to give and unfortunately the documentation has slipped.

**SC**: On exceptions specifically - how comfortable are you with the exception approval process?

**RT**: The process itself is sound. We have a clear authority matrix, we log everything in the Exception Tracking System, and QC reviews all exception loans. What concerns me is the volume - we're seeing more exceptions than I'd like, partly because the product parameters haven't been recalibrated since rates went up. Borrowers are stretching on DTI because of higher payments, and LOs are pushing the envelope. I'd like to see our underwriting team push back more rather than escalating to exception.

**DO**: The exception log shows two entries that were logged unnecessarily - within guidelines but flagged as exceptions.

**RT**: That's actually an overcaution issue rather than an under-documentation issue, which I'd rather have. But you're right, it suggests some confusion about when an exception is actually needed. Training opportunity.

## Volume and Capacity

**SC**: How has the volume trend affected operations?

**RT**: 2024 was uneven. Q1 and Q2 were slow - rates were still elevated and purchase activity was muted. Q3 picked up significantly as rates started coming down. We went from 200 loans/month to 320 in September. Our team wasn't staffed for that surge. Processing times went up, we had a cluster of rate lock extensions, and QC fell behind on their 90-day review window for a while. We've stabilized now but it exposed some capacity planning weaknesses.

**SC**: What's your target cycle time?

**RT**: We target 35-40 days application to funding for purchase, 30-35 for refinance. Reality is we're averaging 42-45 for purchase and 36-38 for refi. The bottleneck is usually in processing - the document collection and condition clearing phase. Underwriting turnaround is solid, usually 2-3 days for a decision. But then conditions come back and the ping-pong between processor and underwriter can add a week or two.

## Risk and Compliance

**SC**: What keeps you up at night from a risk perspective?

**RT**: Three things. First, fair lending. We're growing into new markets and I want to make sure our approval patterns don't show disparities. Angela Torres runs a good monitoring program but I worry about the pricing analysis - we give LOs some discretion on rate and I'm not sure we're monitoring that closely enough. She flagged a pricing pattern with one of our LOs recently that we're looking into.

Second, vendor management. Our third-party oversight has slipped. The AMC and two of our title vendors are overdue for annual due diligence review. We had an internal audit finding on this and we're working to remediate, but it's a resource issue.

Third, operational resilience. We had an Encompass outage in August that took us offline for most of a business day. We had 47 loans in pipeline and had to rush-process three Loan Estimates that were at risk of tolerance violation. We don't have a good manual fallback process for extended system outages.

**DO**: On the vendor management finding - what's the remediation timeline?

**RT**: End of Q1 2025. Vendor Management Office is leading it but they're under-resourced too. We have 14 vendors in the mortgage ecosystem and only one VMO analyst covering all of them plus the bank's other vendor relationships.

## Strategic Direction

**SC**: Where do you see the operation going in the next 12-18 months?

**RT**: We need to grow consumer direct. The branch model is expensive and borrower expectations are shifting. I'd like to get to 35-40% digital by end of 2026. That requires process changes though - we need to build workflows specifically for digital applicants rather than forcing them through the branch process. Also looking at implementing an automated document classification and data extraction tool. Our processors spend too much time manually indexing documents in Encompass.

The other big initiative is self-service condition clearing. Let borrowers upload documents to a portal, have them automatically routed and classified. Right now everything goes through the processor as a bottleneck.
