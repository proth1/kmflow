## Role and Daily Workflow

**DO**: Patricia, tell me about your typical day and how you manage your pipeline.

**PD**: I usually carry 25-30 active files at any given time. My day starts at 7:30 - I check Encompass for any overnight document uploads from borrowers, then review my pipeline sorted by lock expiration date. The files closest to lock expiry get priority. After that I work through condition clearing for any files that came back from underwriting, then I move to new file setup for anything that came in from the LOs.

**DO**: How do you track what needs attention across 25-30 files?

**PD**: Honestly? I use a combination of Encompass milestones and my own Excel spreadsheet. Encompass has pipeline views but it doesn't flag stale documents automatically. So I built a spreadsheet that tracks every document by loan - when it was received, when it expires, and what's still outstanding. I color-code it: green is good, yellow is expiring within a week, red is expired or past due. The whole processing team uses it now. James knows about it.

**DO**: How long have you been using the spreadsheet?

**PD**: About two years. I started it because I had a situation where bank statements expired on a file right before closing and nobody caught it. That was embarrassing - we had to delay the closing by a week to get fresh statements. After that I started tracking manually. I've asked IT probably four or five times to build this into Encompass as an automated alert. They keep saying it's on the backlog.

## Document Collection Challenges

**DO**: What are the biggest bottlenecks in your workflow?

**PD**: Document collection, hands down. Getting borrowers to send complete documents is the number one time sink. I'd say 40% of my day is chasing documents. The initial request goes out within a day of file setup, but then it's follow-up after follow-up. Bank statements are the worst - borrowers send the first page but not all pages, or they send statements that are 3 months old instead of the most recent.

**DO**: How do you handle the follow-up cadence?

**PD**: The Desktop Guide says Day 0, Day 3, Day 5, Day 7, Day 10 for escalation. In practice, I'm more aggressive than that. I call the borrower on Day 2 if I haven't heard back, because by Day 5 you've already lost a week. The guide was written when our volume was lower and cycle times were longer. In today's market with rate locks, you can't afford to wait.

**DO**: Do you feel the Desktop Guide accurately reflects how you work?

**PD**: Not really, no. It hasn't been updated since 2022, and James has been meaning to revise it. Some of the system instructions are outdated - like the section on ordering title still references the old vendor portal we replaced a year ago. And the follow-up cadence I mentioned. Also, the guide doesn't cover consumer direct at all, which is a different intake workflow. When I get a consumer direct file, I'm basically winging it on the setup because there's no documented process for it.

## Third-Party Service Ordering

**DO**: Walk me through how you order appraisals and title.

**PD**: Appraisals go through ValuTrac - that's automated and works well. I submit the order, the AMC rotates it to an appraiser, and I track status in the portal. If it's not assigned within 48 hours I escalate. The only issue is in rural markets or when there's high demand - appraiser assignment can take a week in some areas of west Texas.

Title is more manual. We have a preferred vendor list that we're supposed to rotate quarterly, but in practice I use the vendor I know will deliver quickly based on the property state. For Texas it's usually First American or Stewart. For Florida or Arizona, I have to check the list. There's no systematic rotation tracking - it's informal.

**DO**: Is there a concern about vendor concentration?

**PD**: Maybe? I tend to use the same two or three title companies because I know their process and turnaround times. If Vendor Management has a concern about concentration, nobody has told me. I just want the commitment back in 7-10 days so my file doesn't stall.

## Underwriting Interaction

**DO**: How would you describe the handoff between processing and underwriting?

**PD**: It's gotten better over the years but there's still friction. I submit the file when all my checklist items are done, add a summary note, and route to the underwriting queue. Underwriter picks it up usually within 24-48 hours depending on their queue depth. The frustrating part is when it comes back suspended for something I could have addressed if the underwriter had just called me. Instead they formally suspend, which resets the clock, and then I have to resubmit.

**DO**: Can you give an example?

**PD**: Sure. Last month a file came back suspended because the underwriter wanted clarification on an employer name discrepancy between the VOE and the W-2. The employer had changed their legal entity name - same company, just incorporated differently. I actually had the LOE in my email but forgot to upload it. If the underwriter had pinged me on Teams, I could have uploaded it in 5 minutes instead of a formal suspension and resubmission that took 3 days. But I get it - they have their process too.

**DO**: What about condition clearing? How does that work day to day?

**PD**: Conditions come back categorized as PTD, PTC, or PTF. I work PTD first since those block doc prep. For each condition, I get the documentation, upload it, add a clearing note explaining how it satisfies the condition, and mark it submitted for review. The underwriter is supposed to review within 24 hours but sometimes it takes 48, especially on Fridays. The annoying thing is when they reject a cleared condition and I have to start over. That usually happens on income-related conditions where the underwriter and I have different interpretations of what they wanted.

**DO**: The continuity rule - same underwriter reviews conditions as made the original decision. Does that work in practice?

**PD**: Mostly, but not always. If U.Chen approved the file but she's on PTO, someone else might review the conditions. When that happens, the new underwriter sometimes interprets conditions differently than the original one intended. I've had files where the original underwriter wanted one thing and the reviewing underwriter wanted something different. It's confusing. We try to avoid it but with only three underwriters and vacation schedules, it happens.

## Pain Points and Improvement Ideas

**DO**: If you could change three things about the process, what would they be?

**PD**: First, automated stale document tracking in Encompass. It's insane that we're tracking this manually in 2025. Second, a borrower portal for document upload with automatic classification. Right now everything comes through email or fax and I manually upload and index it. A portal where the borrower sees a checklist and uploads directly would save me hours per file. Third, update the Desktop Guide and create a specific workflow for consumer direct files. Right now I'm treating them the same as branch files but the intake is different and the borrower expectations are different.

**DO**: Anything else you'd flag for our review?

**PD**: The condition clearing cheat sheet that Patricia Johnson put together - have you seen it? It's been super helpful for the team but some of the LTV information in it was wrong. We had a situation recently where a processor assumed 97% LTV was fine for a townhouse because the cheat sheet said so, but the actual policy limit is 95% for townhouse. The underwriter caught it and it ended up as an exception. These informal guides are helpful but they're dangerous if they diverge from official policy.

**DO**: That's a significant finding. Is the cheat sheet still in circulation?

**PD**: Yes, it's on the shared drive. Patricia updated it with a note after the townhouse incident, but the wrong number is still in the main table - she just added a note at the bottom. People might not scroll down to see it.
