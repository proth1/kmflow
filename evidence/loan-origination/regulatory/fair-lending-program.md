## 4. Risk Assessment

### 4.1 Inherent Risk Factors
The Bank assesses fair lending risk across these dimensions:
1. **Product complexity**: Multiple loan products with varying eligibility criteria
2. **Discretionary pricing**: LO ability to adjust rate within published range
3. **Exception authority**: Underwriting exceptions may create disparate treatment
4. **Geographic concentration**: Primarily Texas with expanding CA and FL presence
5. **Channel mix**: Retail branch network with limited consumer direct

### 4.2 Annual Risk Rating
| Risk Category | 2024 Rating | 2023 Rating | Trend |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Pricing disparity | Moderate | Moderate | Stable |
| Underwriting disparity | Low-Moderate | Low | Increasing |
| Steering risk | Low | Low | Stable |
| Marketing/outreach | Low-Moderate | Low-Moderate | Stable |
| Redlining | Low | Low | Stable |

**Note**: Underwriting disparity rating increased due to inconsistent exception documentation practices identified in Q3 2024 review.

## 5. Monitoring Activities
